This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an active ragdoll in Unity Physics (version 2022.3.44f1). When using a `PhysicsJoint` with `BallAndSocket` and `MotorTwist` constraints, the body with joint unexpectedly spins 360 degrees at game start.

Includes a minimal setup and code to reproduce the issue.
